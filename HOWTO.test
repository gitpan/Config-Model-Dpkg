Here are some tips to test this module without building debian package:

* test all:

  prove -l t/
  perl -Ilib t/*.t

* single test

  prove -l t/debian-dpkg.t
  perl -Ilib t/debian-dpkg.t

* pick test case for t/model_test.t

model_test can be quite long to execute as it runs several test cases
(in fact one for every example file located in t/model_test.d/*-examples)

Syntax is:

  perl -Ilib t/model_test.t <flag> <group> <example>

flag can be:
- t: add more verbose trace on STDOUT
- l: print logs configured in ~/.log4config-model
- e: print stack trace when exceptions are thrown

To find group and example, run 
  perl -Ilib t/model_tests.t |grep 'Beginning subtest'

Each subtest name can be used as group and example.

For instance:

 $ perl -Ilib t/model_tests.t x debian-dpkg-control sdlperl
ok 1 - compiled
# Beginning debian-dpkg-control test (t/model_tests.d/debian-dpkg-control-test-conf.pl)
# debian-dpkg-control uses Dpkg::Control model on file control
# Beginning subtest debian-dpkg-control sdlperl
ok 2 - Copied debian-dpkg-control example sdlperl

# End of debian-dpkg-control test

The 'x' flag is ignored

You can run a whole group by omitting the subtest name:

  perl -Ilib t/model_tests.t x debian-dpkg-control
